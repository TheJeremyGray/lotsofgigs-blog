I got some new sharpening equipment for Christmas and decided to clean up my utility chisels.  You know, the ones that sit in the bottom of your toolbox you occasionally use to do un-chisely things like pry or unscrew or throw at unsuspecting trees.

Here are some *before* shots of the chisel.

It's pretty gnarly.  I think I used this chisel to scrape construction adhesive off the back of a mirror and then destroy some nail ridden benches at "[Elmo's On Main](http://goo.gl/maps/NnkE5)", which is now a parking lot.  It also looks like I stuck it in a tree for a year then ran it over with my truck.

I started the process by [lapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapping) the back of the blade.  It's important as a reference angle and was very misaligned.  I don't know if it came from the factory warped or this condition developed over years of misuse and improper storage.  I imagine it came from the factory this way, it's a pretty cheap chisel.  Here is a picture after 20 minutes on a 220 grit diamond stone.

<a href="http://lotsofgigs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2013-01-10-21-15-32.jpg">![2013-01-10 21.15.32](http://lotsofgigs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2013-01-10-21-15-32.jpg?w=300)</a>

I took it through the following grits 220, 360,1000,5000, and finally polished at 8000.  After I was finished with the 8000 grit, the back of the chisel was perfectly flat and I could see my pretty face in the reflection.

At this point, it was time to pick a bevel angle.  I figured this was going to be the standard 25 degrees, but when I measured the existing bevel it was already closer to 30.  So I went with 30 degrees.  It's probably more appropriate for this chisel set anyway since they don't get babied.

I had a lot of work to do on this tip since it had some significant chipping.  In hindsight, this would have been a lot easier on a grinder but it's cold outside (where the grinder is).  After another 20 minutes on the 220 grit diamond plate the tip started looking good.

<a href="http://lotsofgigs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2013-01-10-21-42-121.jpg">![2013-01-10 21.42.12](http://lotsofgigs.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/2013-01-10-21-42-121.jpg?w=640)</a>

What I can't figure out here is how the lower line of the bevel got skewed.  It's pretty significant and I didn't notice until the end.  Since I didn't notice the angle until the end I stopped before applying a micro-bevel.  This finished my hour long first sharpening of an 8 year old chisel and I was pretty happy with the results.

However, here's my last mystery.  I like to use a sharpie on the blade to keep track of how much material I have taken off.  Because of this, the slurry on the stones gets stained with a little bit of black dye.  The first time I used the Shapton 8000 grit stone, the slurry filled in some "pits" on the surface of the stone.  I'm not sure if this is normal or not, I've got to call the manufacturer...maybe I'll point them to this post.

You can see the pits on the left and right of the flattened stone in which the sharpie dye has settled.  I'm not really sure if this is OK or a manufacturing defect on the stone.
