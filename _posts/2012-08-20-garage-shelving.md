If you haven't had the privilege of seeing my garage lately, here is a photo.

That is exactly one parking spot of wood I bought off craigslist.  There is more in the corners that can't be seen from this angle.  The stack in the foreground is a locally grown and milled [black gum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyssa_sylvatica) tree. The background is an assortment of [bubinga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guibourtia), [swiss pear](http://www.higginshardwoods.com/products.php/specialtyhardwoods/swisspear), [zebrawood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebrawood), [mahogany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahogany), and a few others I am still trying to identify.

**The Problem**: I can no longer park in the garage.

**The Solution**: Shelves

I checked out a lot of off-the-shelf garage storage solutions, some good and some bad.  The one I liked the most was called "[Monkey Bars Garage Storage Solutions](http://www.monkeybarstorage.com/louisville-garage-storage)".  It seemed like the most well constructed of all the solutions I checked out.  I had a meeting with the local franchise owner Greg and he drew me out a fantastic system.  Unfortunately, the fantastic system happened to be a lot more than I wanted to spend.  So I decided to build my own with the huge stack of wood in my garage.

**Requirements**


1.  24 in deep shelves
2.  1000 lb per bracket weight limit

My first stop on any project around the house is [McMaster-Carr](http://www.mcmaster.com/), they stock 490,000 products...so if I can't find it there I usually change my design.  I decided on 4 [Heavy Duty Steel 18" h x 24" d](http://www.mcmaster.com/#standard-shelving-brackets/=iu1l8b) brackets at about $28 each to be attached with some black [3" lag bolts](http://www.mcmaster.com/#catalog/118/3019/=iu1lpb) that cost $7.50 for a box of 25.  Since I have an essentially unlimited supply of wood I decided to make a decorative face places that would give me the option of copying the Monkey Bars awesome storage solution at a later date if I outgrow my pegboard.

**The Process**


1.  Run a 7 in wide piece of gum through the planer, jointer, and tablesaw until it is flat on all 4 sides.
2.  Use a 1/2" round-over bit on the router table to put a decorative edge on three sides of the board.
3.  Plane another 1/32" to clean up the lip I accidentally put on the piece with the router.
4.  Coat with 1 part Linseed Oil + 2 parts Mineral Oil on the front and back, twice.
5.  Mount finished wood pieces to the wall making sure the countersunk screws are hidden behind where the bracket will go.  Also making sure the pieces are level across all four 4' spans.
6.  Mount bracket with 3" lag bolt.
7.  Repeat three more times, keeping the deck of the shelves level across all brackets.
8.  Fill with wood.
9.  Park in the garage
I decided not to put decking on the shelves because I was just going to use it for wood storage.  When I start to run out of wood I imagine the last few pieces will will be used to create the deck.  The pictures below show the mounted brackets and a sample of the wood to come, respectively.

The picture on the right is about 1/3 of the gum, it seemed to be holding strong so I decided to put all of it onto the new shelves.

My favorite parts of this project are below.

The fact there is no more wood on the floor of my garage is great, I'm not quite ready to park a car in here...but its close.  I also really like how I recessed the shelf into the existing pegboard, I think it looks nice.

It took me about two hours to prepare the decorative pieces from rough stock to stained finished product and about three hours to mount it on the wall.  I figured I paid myself about $250 an hour on this project, I'll put one in your garage for $800.
