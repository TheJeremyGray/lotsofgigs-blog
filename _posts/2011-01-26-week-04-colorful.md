My original goal this week was to get out of the house for my challenge photo.  I thought I would be able to find more inspiration when I wasn't confined.  The snow that we got kept me from venturing to the great outdoors with my camera, but it didn't completely hold me back.  

Jeremy and I went to the mall on Sunday and I thought surely I could find some inspiration and brightly colored objects at one of the stores.  I walked through a cosmetics store and may have gotten a great shot there, but they were not too keen on that.  We moved on and headed towards the Home department of Macy's.  They have a wonderful display of [Fiestaware](macys.com/Fiestaware) that screams "colorful".  I liked the shot below, but I didn't love it.  I needed something else.

We headed down the escalator towards the Men's department.  I thought I had something there.  Ties.  Tables and tables of ties.  Ties in every color you can imagine.  Again, I liked one of the shots, but there was no love.

By that point we were spent and headed home.  A challenge entry from the mall was not meant to be.  On Monday I had to run an errand at Walgreens.  I brought my camera along to revisit the cosmetics idea.  I snapped a few photos of the nail polish displays and a few of the lipstick and went on my way.  I still had nothing.

As I returned from my errand I decided to look inside the house for my inspiration despite my original goal.  I didn't have to look far because as I walked into the kitchen I immediately thought about my mixing bowls.  I have a six piece set of melamine mixing bowls.  Each bowls is a different bold color.  I also have a matching set of little prep bowls in the same colors.  The bowls were a gift from our wedding registry and one of my favorite things.  The colors of the bowls are just fun and happy.  I was in love with them when I saw them at the store and I am in love with them today.

The mixing bowl set is somewhat large so I grabbed the prep bowls and my [lightbox](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrs_rev/3939065001/in/set-72157622421400266/) and went to work.

*My fancy photo shoot setup: A homemade lightbox, two desk lamps, and poster board *



First I tried stacking the bowls.  Then I tried stacking them upside down.  I took shots from a distance.  I took shots close up.  I used my 50mm lens, my 24mm lens, my 18-55mm lens.  I switched to macro mode.  I tried a lot of different things and wasn't getting the right shot.  They just were not very interesting.  As I rearranged the bowls yet again, they fell over.  Before scooping them back up into a stack, I snapped a few shots.   Now I was getting an interesting shot.  I tried to rearrange the bowls into another "fallen" state, but couldn't get anything as good as when they fell on their own.  I took a few more photos, but I already had my shot.  I uploaded it andworked the levels to get the black background to be a true black, then bumped the contrast just a bit.  

The color is bold and bright and looks good with the black background.  I like this photo also because of the meaning behind it.  These bowls are special to me.  They are something that I love and were a gift from someone I love.  My mom gave them to me and had to run all around town to find them.  We laughed about the story when I told her my photo's subject.

This week taught me that you can't always set up the perfect shot, sometimes it just happens on its own, but you have to keep trying until it does.

4 weeks down.  48 to go.
