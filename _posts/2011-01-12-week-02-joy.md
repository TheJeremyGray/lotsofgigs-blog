One would think a trip to the Caribbean would lead to all kinds of "joy" photos.  That was not the case for me.  This photo had potential, but it was a little too dark.  I made a few different attempts to edit it and bring it to life, but it was just not meant to be.

celebrating Three Kings in St. Croix.*



Since there were no joyful vacation shots I needed to find something in my current surroundings.  The snow that was waiting at home was not joyful at all.  This limited my options.  I turned to my dogs.  They were not cooperative.  I guess we need to work on the "wag" command.

*Belly Rubs = Joy?*



After my dog photo shoot fail, I started thinking about things that brought me joy.  I love candy.  It's a lovely weakness.  Chocolate in particular.  The first idea I had was a plate of M&amp;M's.  This got my wheels spinning.  My husband and I have stolen a joke from [Cougar Town](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441109/) regarding M&amp;M's.  On [the show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKvVl0VeWvc) Courteney Cox is upset over a break up.  Her friend hands her a mug full of M&amp;M's stating "This will make you feel better."  Courteney's response: "Mmmm, M&amp;M tea.".  Hilarious.  And also the inspiration for my challenge photo.

I started with a mug of M&amp;M's.  I put the mug in my [light box](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrs_rev/3939065001/in/set-72157622421400266/) and started shooting.  I got a few neat shots, but they didn't quite hit the spot.  I took 13 photos of the mug in the light box.

Here are the unedited and edited versions of one of those photos.

I stared at the mug and tried to figure out the best way to represent the "tea" portion of M&amp;M tea.  I imagined holding a warm mug. There it was.  I grabbed the mug out of the light box and headed to a comfortable chair.  I set up my tripod and used my remote control to take some shots.  The important part of the shot was being able to see the M&amp;M's inside the mug.  Once I got that angle right, I had my shot.  It took 13 tries.  I worked the levels, contrast, color balance, and a little bit of curves for the editing.  A vignette was added to help bring the focus to the M&amp;M's.

This shot tells more of a story than the one of just the mug.

This week taught me three things.  One, you can't always save a picture with editing and you just have to accept it and move on.  Two, keep thinking and trying new perspectives.  I could have taken 50 shots of that mug in the light box and gotten no where.  I realized this, stopped, and came up with an alternative take.  It paid off.

The third thing...my dog likes M&amp;M tea as much as I do.

2 weeks down. 50 to go.
