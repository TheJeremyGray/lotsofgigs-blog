Walking down the hallway at work last Wednesday, I happened to overhear some co-workers talking about pet spiders.  I immediately knew this would make a good challenge subject.  Fear.  Spiders.  They just go together.  


Meet Mathilda.  She's a [Chilean Rose Hair Tarantula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_rose_tarantula).  I would not like to meet her in a dark alley.

My original idea was to set up a shot with the spider on someone's back while they sat at their desk working, unaware of the spider's presence.  The fear in this shot would be the viewer's as they imagined being the person with a spider on their back.  It makes me cringe, just thinking about it now.  No one volunteered to have Mathilda placed on their back so I moved to Plan B.  Same concept, just with Mathilda on the desk, slowly making her way towards the hand on the mouse.  

This was a good shot and I like it, but it did not speak "fear" as much as I had hoped.  If I could play the "Jaws" music in the background, it would help. :)

In the midst of the photo shoot, I decided it would be a good idea to hold Mathilda.  I'm not sure why I thought holding this <del datetime="2011-02-16T15:32:05+00:00">hairy, venomous</del> lovely creature was a good idea, but I went ahead and did it anyway.  Plus one on my Adventure count.  I made sure I had proof of this event as I know there are many people who would not believe I did it.

*This is me.  Holding a tarantula.*




Mathilda was really quite calm.  Much more calm than I was when she first came out of her cage.  She just strolled along.  During one of her strolls I captured the photo below.  I like the way her leg is up, off of the hand.  It gives you a sense of movement.  The detail is good.  You can make out the little hairs on her legs.  To edit this picture, I adjusted the levels, bumped the contrast, then converted to black and white by decreasing the saturation.  I then added more contrast and made a few duplicate layers in Screen mode to really lighten the image.
