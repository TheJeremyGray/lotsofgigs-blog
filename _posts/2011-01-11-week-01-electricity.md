The first week of the challenge came at a hectic time.  We had guests in town, hosted a party, then packed up and went on vacation.  With so much going on I had a hard time being inspired. What helps me those most in these situations is to get the camera out and just start shooting.  Since I didn't have a plan for this week's challenge, the concept evolved with each shot.


I started by shooting a compact fluorescent light bulb.  I shot from below.  I shot from above.  I tried to get a different angles to make this everyday object a little more interesting.  I shot 38 photos before moving on.

Once I was focused on the subject, more ideas started flowing.  I headed for our basement where a wiring project had just been completed.  The wires that had been run in the wall did not inspire me, but I found a small bundle of scraps and started shooting again.  I couldn't get my camera close enough with my 50mm lens, so I switched to my 18-55mm kit lens.  Still not getting what I wanted, I flipped the dial to Macro mode so I could get a little bit closer.  Unfortunately, using this mode puts the camera on full auto and it does whatever it wants, including popping up the built in flash.  The direct flash was a little harsh. I grabbed a piece of scrap paper that was lying on a shelf and used it to diffuse the flash.  In the end, the diffused flash gave some nice shine to bits of the copper coming out of the shielding.  I took 47 photos of that bundle of wires.

I was done taking photos. The next step was to pick the best photos and do some editing.

I really loved one of the light bulb photos.  The unedited and edited shots are shown below.

This photo was so crisp and I found the perspective interesting.   I decreased the saturation a bit so the bulb wouldn't be quite so yellow.

I eventually decided that this shot of the wires was the winner.  I like the [bokeh ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh)on the ends of some of the wires.  The way the flash is reflecting off the copper makes the wires come alive to me, as if the electricity was shooting out of them.  Then the splashes of red add some more visual interest.  This shot was cropped, horizontally flipped and the levels were adjusted to correct the white balance.

This week taught me to make the effort even when it's hard and you think you are "too busy".    That effort was rewarded with two great shots.  

1 week down. 51 to go.
