Last Wednesday afternoon on my way out of work I started brainstorming ideas for this week's subject, control.  Quite a few things came to mind: in control, out of control, remote control, video game control, control-alt-delete.  I continued thinking about control as I headed towards my destination, a Pilates class.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates" target="_blank">Pilates</a> is an exercise technique.  Joseph Pilates, the creator, called it *Contrology. *He said, "Nothing about the Pilates Method is haphazard. The reason you need to concentrate so thoroughly is so you can be in control of every aspect of every moment."

As I continued towards my class, the light bulb came on.

Once I had the inspiration, it was on to the execution.  I didn't quite know how to convey the "control" that was happening during the exercises.   I couldn't visualize the shot that I wanted.  I needed to be able to see the movements and get at different angles on the fly.  I needed a model.

I had class again on Saturday and I came prepared, camera in tow.  The next challenge was to choose a model and actually ask a classmate to be that model.  The idea of approaching someone and asking to take her picture  made me nervous.  I had recently read "if it’s slightly uncomfortable to ask, you probably should".    I used this phrase to push me forward.  I also knew this was the best opportunity to get my shot.

After class Laura quickly agreed to be my model.  We set her up against a blank wall and we both went to work.  She gracefully moved through several exercises as I snapped away.  We had to work fast as the yoga students were getting ready for their class.  The pressure created by the short time frame and the other students milling about made it harder for me to focus.  The whole "shoot" lasted about five minutes and I captured 41 photos.  I thanked Laura and hurried home to review the photos.

I uploaded the images to my computer and started flipping through them.  The shots were good, but I wasn't feeling "control" coming out of them.  My husband Jeremy looked over them with me and made the suggestion to layer several images together to show the movement of the exercise.  I loved the idea and knew it would challenge my editing skills.

Here are the three images I started with, unedited:

I got to work using the [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/).  I started with the base image and copied in the other two images as separate layers.  Since I didn't have my camera on a tripod, it took some tweaking to get the images lined up.  Even with them lined up the result was not a cohesive image.  I used layer masks to mask out the background, head, shoulders, and arms on the second and third images.  This was the most time consuming part.  The biggest challenge, however, was blending the neck and shoulders between all of the images and having it look natural.  I set the transparency of the second and third images around 50%.  After the images were blended, I worked the levels, converted to black and white, bumped the contrast, and added a vignette.

The final image shows the control it takes to move through the exercise. The body has to fight against gravity to allow the movement to flow. Without control, the body would just collapse down.

This week taught me three things.  The biggest thing is to not be afraid to approach people.  It's ok if you're uncomfortable, but do it anyway.  The worst that can happen is they will say no.  Most of the time though, they'll say yes.  The second thing is how to blend multiple images during post-processing.  This was the first time I had attempted this, and while not perfect, I am happy with the results.  If I ever plan a shot that will be blended I will use my tripod to help the images come together easier.

The third thing is that my brother and I think a lot alike.  Check out his <a href="http://arightgapesnest.blogspot.com/2011/01/photo-challenge-control.html" target="_blank">control photo</a>.
