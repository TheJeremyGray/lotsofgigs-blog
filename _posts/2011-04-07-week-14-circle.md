I took a lot of pictures this week.  Circles are everywhere, but I was having a hard time capturing them in an interesting way.  

I started out setting things up in my light box.

Here are some hair ties.  Jeremy said this photo is "like the Olympics, only better".  I liked it, but it was too flat.

Here's one of my lenses.  It's in the light box, but I ended up moving one of the lights to shine straight on.  I needed more light to get a sharp shot, but the background washed out.  This one was also flat.

The dogs were hanging out with me during my photo shoot.  I wasn't feeling very inspired by circles, so I turned my camera on them.  I'm excited about these shots because I took them in Manual mode with a custom white balance and they turned out great.  These two are straight out of the camera.

They get bored pretty easily, but that's good for me because they slow down.  Here they were hanging out at the top of the stairs.  I didn't set a custom white balance here and ended up converting to black and white because the tungsten light gave such a strong yellow cast.

I continued my search for circles the next day.  I wandered around the house searching for inspiration.  While in the kitchen, I looked up and saw my red colander.  This is another item we received as a [wedding gift](http://lotsofgigs.wordpress.com/2011/01/26/week-04-colorful/).  It is purely decorative and sits on top of a stack of cookbooks.  I love the deep red color.

I pulled it down and started shooting.  I realized quickly that it worked best to have light coming through the drain holes.  To accomplish this I held the colander in one hand and the camera in the other.  I also wanted to get only white showing through the holes so I ended up standing on a chair and using one of the other chairs as the background.  To add to the challenge, I had to hold it at just the right angle for the light to reflect properly and steady enough for my desired shutter speed.

I worked the manual exposure again this week.  I'm pretty happy with the results I am getting.   The three set up shots above are all straight out of the camera and I love how bright they are.

This final shot has a lot of depth and a lot of circles.  I like the combination of the bright red and the bright white.  My favorite part though is the orange/yellow color on the left side.  This came from the grass outside reflecting on the shiny surface.  The edits here were pretty simple.  I used levels to set the white of the background and gave a little bump to the contrast.  I added a layer and set it's mode to "Hard Light" which gave it a little more pop.
