I racked my brain all week for ideas on large, but had a hard time coming up with anything interesting.

I stopped one afternoon and took some photos of this guy.  An interesting sculpture and definitely large, I just didn't capture it in a way that I really liked.  I did like the little bottle of honey that someone put there for him.

*Bears love honey.  And picnic baskets.*




Then I remembered this very large wine glass in my china cabinet.  I filled it up and snapped some shots.  The scale of the glass just did not come through in the photos.

Today I went for a walk at lunch and happened upon some landscapers working.  This truck was in the driveway.  This idea had been in my mind, but I hadn't had the opportunity to execute it.  Hoping the workers wouldn't notice, I casually snapped just 4 shots.  However, the guy up in a tree, trimming had a clear view of me.  As I started to walk off, he jokingly yelled out that I owed him $20 for the picture.  I laughed...and kept walking. :)

This is my shot.  I cropped it to fill the frame to make the truck seem even larger.  I did the usual edits on levels and contrast.  Then I added a layer in the Hard Light mode, but dropped its transparency to soften the effect.

This week taught me you won't always be inspired and you won't always love your shot, but you still have to get it done.

9 weeks down. 43 to go.
