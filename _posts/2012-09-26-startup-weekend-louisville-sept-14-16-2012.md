I've been following [startup weekend](http://startupweekend.org) for a long time.

Startup Weekends are 54-hour events where developers, designers, marketers, product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups! [Link](http://startupweekend.org/about/)

I almost [drove to Lexington](http://goo.gl/maps/HbXYo) last year year for their November weekend but it was so close to Thanksgiving and I had family plans.

When I found out there was an event being [hosted in Louisville](http://louisville.startupweekend.org/) I jumped at the opportunity.  I really wanted to pitch an idea and spent the better part of a week trying to think of something.  My criteria


*   It had to be a hot topic today, I knew I would have to inspire people to a join a team.
*   It had to monetize, lets face it even non-profits make a profit.
*   I didn't want a novelty idea, like an app that predicts what dogs are thinking.
*   I really wanted something that could chip away at a larger social problem.
*   I wanted something that focused on people.
*   I wanted something I couldn't do on my own.
As I was driving to the event I saw a truck on the side of the road and [flashed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intersect#.22Flashes.22).  I saw an old man sitting next to a truck full of vegetables on the side of the road.  I thought to myself,
<p style="text-align:right;">*There has to be a better way for agricultural producers to bring their product to market.*
-Jeremy Gray

<p style="text-align:left;">So I thought I would internet a solution to this problem...
For those of you who haven't quit reading after quoting myself and using 'internet' as a verb,  the following article is how I figured this problem could be solved by **creating an electronic platform** for **local farmers** to post their wares and for **local consumers** to be able to comparison shop and **buy produce** at their convenience.  The only problem I saw, initially, was the physical hand-off.  I didn't want to court the farmers market crowd, those people are going to get their organic artichokes no matter what obstacles they must surmount.  I wanted people of all age, race, and creed to have access to fresh, local produce and in order for that to become a reality all I had to do was figure out distribution. This idea seemed to be in line with my original goals




*   Hot topic: farmers market, local, organic, green...check
*   Monetize: I get paid a percentage when a consumer swipes their card...check
*   Novelty: This is powerful stuff, people helping people...check
*   Social Impact: Giving people access to food, nuff said...check
*   People: Like I said, people helping people...check
*   On my own: This is a large project that will need community advocates, artists, and is a larger technological footprint than I would bite off on my own...check
<p style="text-align:left;">So I decided to pitch it.  As a side note, everything I have written up until this point happened in about 20 minutes.

<p style="text-align:left;">**Enter the team**

<p style="text-align:left;">Friday Night there were 15 pitches and the group voted for the top six.  My electronic farmers market idea was at the top of the pack.  A team formed around the idea and we set out to feed the world.  We decided to put together a survey and visit a farmers market in the morning to recruit farmers for beta testing and see if there were any pain points that we should identify.  Here are the questions we decided to ask the farmers




1.  Do you ever have product go to waste?
2.  Do you have a smartphone or internet access?
3.  Do you do anything to lock in sales before the market?
4.  Would you be interested in a product that did?
5.  How do you decide on the products you bring to market?
6.  How do you determine vegetable price?
7.  How do you feel about CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture)?
We decided that, initially, people could buy produce and pick it up at the farmers market.  We felt that was our minimum viable product and could later add a delivery or drop-off service.

I couldn't sleep on Friday night, I was convinced this idea was awesome and I was going to be on the cover of Time magazine sitting on a throne of vegetables.  This was one of our brainstorming documents

<a href="http://lotsofgigs.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/farmers-market-brainstorm.jpg">![](http://lotsofgigs.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/farmers-market-brainstorm.jpg?w=1024 "Farmers Market Brainstorm")</a>We met at the farmers market on Saturday, spread out and started talking to people.  It took about an hour for our dreams to come crashing down.  Our whole idea hinged on farmers logging into our system on Monday, taking pictures of produce, uploading those pictures and setting a price.  We thought they would want to do this so they could get paid prior to coming to market on Saturday and help estimate how much to bring to market...getting their money faster and eliminating waste.  Lesson learned: *Farmers wanna farm.  *They don't want to fart around with computers.

**So we had a choice
**We could build a system that nobody wanted, hope to show some early success with entrepreneurial farmers and pray that the rest of the guys would be jealous of the fat wallets and empty fields we created.  Sound familiar?  That's because its the plot of an American classic, [Field of Dreams](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/)

Good movie, bad business.[/caption]

**So we drank
**We hit a dead end.  The electronic farmers market was dead.  We needed a new idea, a new twist.  We decided to get some "marketing juice" at 1:00 pm on Saturday.  This is where we came up with the worst idea I have ever been involved with.  A recipe blog.  We were going to create a food blog where people could download easy recipes featuring in-season produce they *could* buy at the farmers market.  We were going to get local chefs and restaurants to create content, do targeted advertising, and sell a meal plan.  We were going to pitch a blog to a group of venture capitalists.  There was much discussion, we were all lukewarm on the idea and put it to a vote.  We decided to finish the weekend with a food blog.  I've never been so embarrassed in my life, but we had to do something and it's all we had.  Here is the [elevator pitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZaOLgiTNJ8&amp;feature=youtu.be), which was recorded about 15 minutes after we voted on the new concept.  After spending an hour on this idea everyone knew it was terrible.  Out of desperation, we grabbed one of the event organizers and asked for help.  [Here is a tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacharyCohn/status/247114256108109825) he posted right after our session.

**Birth of an idea that didn't stink
**The original premise was good.  We stayed on that path and late on Saturday night came up with

Since the farmers were out, we decided to buy a truck and cut them out of the loop.  Here is our [investor pitch](http://lotsofgigs.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=906).  I think its a great idea, but we all knew that we didn't want to spend our nights driving a truck from farm to market no matter how solid the financials were.  Instead we spent all day Sunday working on the pitch just hoping we wouldn't look like idiots.  I wish the pitch was on video because it was great.  Here is my favorite graphic and a compelling argument for our idea:<a href="http://lotsofgigs.wordpress.com/2012/09/26/startup-weekend-louisville-sept-14-16-2012/startup-weekend-pitch/" rel="attachment wp-att-906">

Those are NOT where our customers are. Our customers are in between all those pins."[/caption]
<p style="text-align:left;">This is a population density heat map of [Jefferson County](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_KY).  Where the color is darker, the population is more dense and where the pins are located are sites of existing farmers markets.  I think this graph shows definite locations within our city that are under served by traditional farmers markets.

<p style="text-align:left;">I also think it is compelling that you can only get local produce before noon on the weekends.

<p style="text-align:left;">**Lessons Learned
**In the end, we didn't win.  I was pretty sure we wouldn't because we didn't have a product.  Just an idea and a guy named Willie that was going to sell us a box truck for $5500.  One of the big lessons I learned was "Fail fast, fail cheap".  I had a great time and am ready to spend another weekend chasing a crazy idea.  The website, [SproutHub.co](http://www.SproutHub.co),will be up until approximately December 16th, 2012.  Check it out, let me know what you think.
