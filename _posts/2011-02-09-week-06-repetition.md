When I heard "repetition" I thought of the repetition of everyday life.  Everyday I get up, take a shower, get dressed, go to work.  I considered taking a picture each day at a particular time as a way to capture this routine.  I couldn't figure out how I would use that to demonstrate repetition, so I kept thinking.  Everyday I take a shower and in the shower I wash my hair. 

I considered ways to show repetition with a bottle of shampoo.  My first thought was quite literal: put the bottle in front of a mirror, add a second mirror and capture the object with infinite reflections.  This wasn't a bad idea, but didn't seem very creative.  I spent the whole [last photo challenge](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrs_rev/sets/72157622160363686/) taking pictures of objects.  I needed to reach a little farther.

Every bottle of shampoo has some version of "lather, rinse, repeat" written on it.  That phrase has become part of our society’s vocabulary to describe a repetitave process.  I recently saw a presentation that described a number of steps for solving a problem.  The last few steps needed to be repeated until everything was resolved.  The presenter described the steps, then stated "lather, rinse, repeat".

I imagined a person with shampoo in their hair.  The image would be bright and bold with a lot of contrast.  The phrase "lather, rinse, repeat" needed to be obvious for the image to make sense with the subject, otherwise it would just be a person with shampoo in their hair.  A different image would need to represent each word.

I grabbed the tripod, remote control, vanity stool, and a floor lamp and headed to the bathroom.  I took shots looking at the camera with wet hair and shaking my head and capturing the movement of my hair.  The shots weren't very interesting and didn't really speak to "rinsing" your hair.  I took more photos looking at the camera with shampooed hair.  Those were also boring.  I added some action to the shot by rubbing my fingers through my hair.  This was better, but there were no shampoo bubbles left.  

I had spent over an hour on the shoot and was disappointed I didn't have more to show for it.  Determined to get *something*, I grabbed the following photo, cropped it and edited it.  I really liked the crop, but there were no shampoo bubbles.

I pulled everything back into the bathroom the next day, soaked my hair with water, and started shooting.  This time for "rinse" I imagined leaning my head back under the shower, allowing the water to wash the shampoo away.  I brought my hands up as if I was pushing the water down the back of my head.  I drenched my hair with more water, then added the shampoo.  Lots of bubbles.  I had to shoot fast before they disappeared.  I imitated the pose I liked from the previous day: hands in hair, scrubbing.  

The funny part of these photo shoots is actually getting the pictures taken.  I used the two second delay button on my remote, which I held between my knees.  I'd press the button then quickly bring my hands back to my head.  I'd do this several times in a row, then get up and check the camera.  Then "lather, rinse, repeat" until I had enough shots.

I grabbed my three favorite shots, cropped them, and started editing.  I worked the shots in parallel to keep them uniform in color.  I adjusted the levels to lighten the foreground, bumped the contrast, bumped the saturation, and adjusted the color balance.  I created a new, blank image in [The Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) with a black base layer for the background.  The individual, cropped shots were pasted on to separate layers in the new image.  I lined everything up then merged the layers into one.  I made a duplicate of the merged layer and set its mode to Screen to add more  brightness.  The whole concept for the image was built off of the phrase "lather, rinse, repeat" so I added the text to further demonstrate this.

I love the way this image turned out.  It's very similar to what I had imagined and I'm so excited I was able to create it.

This week taught me to push myself farther.  Taking photos of shampoo bottles would have been much simpler and less time consuming, but not near as challenging and exciting.  It also taught me to not give up.  I felt pretty defeated after my first photo shoot.  I was so excited about the concept, but the images just didn't work.  I thought about it, figured out what needed to be changed, and tried again.  I could not be happier with the results.

6 weeks down. 46 to go.
