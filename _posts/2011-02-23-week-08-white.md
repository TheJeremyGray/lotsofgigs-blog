I have spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen lately and white is everywhere in there.  Flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, eggs, milk, whipping cream.  When combined in the right proportions these white ingredients can lead to wonderful things.  Get the proportions wrong and you have a mess, but we won't talk about that.  The end result of my baking adventure this week was not white.   It did involve Oreos and that's where I started my photo shoot this week.

I grabbed a plate and a handful of cookies.  I pulled my light box out of the closet and set up my lamps.  I very carefully twisted the top off of one of the Oreos to display more of the creamy goodness inside.  I got a few shots, but the white was not as pronounced as I had hoped.

What goes better with Oreos than a big glass of cold milk?  I LOVE milk.  Really.  I can drink half a glass of milk in one big drink.  My husband says I drink milk like a frat boy drinking beer at a keg party.  True story.  

I poured a big glass and stuck it in the light box.  I snapped a few shots, then added in the cookies.  

I really like this shot.  The angle has my name written all over it.

I like this one with the cookies added in.  It just seemed a little boring.

I like the perspective on the final shot.  The cookies and milk are centered, but the top of the glass is cut off.  I also like that you can see the white cream in the middle of the cookies which accents the glass of milk nicely.  I started editing by rotating the image slightly to straighten it.  Then I used levels to remove some of the yellow cast from the lamp light.  I removed any remaining yellow by decreasing the yellow saturation.  I bumped the contrast and used curves to brighten the whites a little more.  The end result is a delicious looking photo.
