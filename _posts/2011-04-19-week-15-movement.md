I had a hard time coming up with a concept this week.  I wanted to show movement, but I also wanted to have a sharp, crisp photo.  

For this shot I flipped a bike upside down to keep it stable, then attached a taillight on the inside of the wheel.  I gave the wheel a spin and used a long shutter speed to capture the glow of the taillight.  Light coming from inside the house lit up the metal components of the bike.  

When I started shooting, I framed the shot tight enough that you couldn't tell the bike was upside down.  As I continued though, I moved farther and farther back to get more of the bike in the frame.  I ended up flipping, rotating, and cropping the image to account for this.  I also worked the levels and contrast, then added a Hard Light layer.
