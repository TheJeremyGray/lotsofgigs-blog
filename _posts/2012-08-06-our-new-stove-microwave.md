Our kitchen was probably really nice in 1972.

Dark wood cabinetry, green speckled melamine counters with a matching back-splash, and harvest gold appliances.  The previous owner painted the cabinets for us with a lovely latex wall paint and replaced with hardware handles that look terrible next to the hinges (thanks HGTV!).  They also replaced the cook-top and stove with black appliances.  The size also makes me laugh, its the perfect space for one person.

Our plan has always been a complete renovation of the kitchen, but we can't seem to find the time to start the project.  A few weeks ago, my wife had enough and we bought new appliances from [Chenoweth Appliances](http://www.chenowethappliances.com/), whom I highly recommend.  The separate stove and cook-top are great if you have the space, but we don't. So the decision was made to go to a traditional range with an overhead microwave and bag the cook-top.  Herein lies the problem...where do you put a traditional range in this kitchen?

Here is a progression of construction pictures

1.  Wall removal. Had to run a 110 into the cabinet and redid insulation.  In wall stoves are also directly wired into the 220, so I had to put in a box as well.
2.  Sealed up wall, the is the worst/fastest drywall job I have ever done.
3.  Wall painted with a doggie protection barrier

1.  Stove Installed
2.  Microwave and Upper Cabinet Installed
3.  A Woman's Touch
I'm happy with the way it turned out.  There is only one thing I would change if I had to do it all over.  I ran the 110V power outlet for the microwave in the cabinet to the left of the stove and I probably should have done it in the wall behind the new overhead cabinet.  I just had to drill some extra holes in the cabinetry.  I'm also happy with how much this project cost (except for the actual appliances).


*   4 x 8 Drywall: $8
*   Double Gang Electrical Box: $4
*   220V Receptacle: $5
*   220V Receptacle Cover: $4 (I splurged on stainless)
*   New Upper Cabinet: $89
Paint, insulation, framing, and all other drywall materials were leftovers from previous projects.  I still need to put door handles on the upper cabinets and level the new cabinet doors.  I'm also going to remove the cook-top and replace it with a [bubinga](http://www.higginshardwoods.com/products.php/specialtyhardwoods/bubinga) insert so my wife can have a little more preparation space.  I am tossing around putting the old cabinet doors on the new cabinet to make it all match.  Any thoughts?
