Let me start by saying this is one of the strangest things I have ever done.
My friend Alan and I responded to the following craigslist post
<h2 style="padding-left:30px;">free timber, you cut it: 7 huge walnut trees (Fern Creek)


<p style="padding-left:30px;">We have 6 to 8 large, mature Walnut trees on our property. All are old growth, and have been here since before the neighborhood was created back in the 60s. We have been told they would be great for anyone with a woodworking business . Worst case scenario, you have a **** ton of hard firewood for the winter. You can have the timber/lumber from these trees, all you have to do is cut it down. They are TALL. You will need a bucket truck or something comparable for this. If some brave soul wants to climb for this gig, that's all on you. Actual timber companies welcome, so are private individuals.

We met the property owner and came up with an arrangement.  Basically, we are going to cut the trees down for free, take the trunks and he is going to clean up all the mess.

**The Plan**

There are six trees on the property, shown on a topographical map below.

Here are some individual pictures of the trees

So, we decided to rent a [Genie S-65](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.genielift.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fnew-equipment%2Fboom-lifts%2Ftelescopic-booms%2Fs60x-s65%2Findex.htm&amp;ei=HAxSUN-JG4um8ASP_IHoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1Ehl-Gkxa5ZRdlXmMKFSeb7id9g&amp;sig2=nzM0FxhSAnYVuI2luxEkjQ), start with Tree #6 and work back to Tree # 1, taking the tops of the tree off as we go.  After all the tops are down, we will push the brush out of the way with a tractor and start felling the trunks.  Finally, the trunks will get cut into 100 inch sections and winched onto a 10,000lb capacity trailer for hauling to the [Woodmizer LT15](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodmizer.com%2Fus%2FPortableEquipment%2FManualSawmills%2FLT15Sawmill.aspx&amp;ei=tAxSUP2-JYf88QSn04HoDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFKiBSyEtPby5RBi0g1UWXPmxZOA&amp;sig2=fAIx088U3hHXP0bKL83fhA).

**The Equipment**

You could summit Everest with this thing, it weighs about 20,000 lbs.  I can't wait to get behind the control panel with a chainsaw.  We went with this model because we don't feel like climbing 75 ft trees and weren't comfortable felling the tree's in the confined space.

I'm not going to bore you with pictures of tractors and trailers, you've seen them before. However, the Woodmizer is one of the coolest things any of my friends own, hopefully I can get some pictures of us milling this wood.

Hopefully this will yield about 1100 [BDFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_foot) of milled Walnut, after we get done I may post how we got this number.

It will be a few weeks before this little project gets started...stay tuned.  If you don't hear from me before October 1st, unsubscribe from this blog...because I have fallen out of a tree and am no longer able to type.  If we can pull this off, I'll be happier than Gallagher at a farmers market.
