Several months ago we bought a used drafting table.  A friend of a friend of a friend was moving to Florida for retirement and selling everything in his workshop.  Jeremy picked out the table and brought it home.  This purchase also included all of the contents of the table.  There were some very cool, old drafting supplies in there.  

This set of [French curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Curves) was one of those things.  I'm not sure how old this particular set is, but they still looked interesting.

I  stuck them in the drawer of the table and started shooting.

The main edit I did on this shot was the levels.  This really made the wood background pop.  I bumped the contrast a tiny bit and called it a day.  This shot turned out great.  It's interesting and the wood gives it a real warmth.
