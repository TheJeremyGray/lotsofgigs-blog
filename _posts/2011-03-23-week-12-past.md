I dug out my old yearbooks to use as my subject this week.  It has been 10 years since I graduated high school.  

The book on top is the Senior Memories book I convinced my mom to buy for me at the beginning of the school year.  I remember it being somewhat pricey, but I'm so glad I got it.  That thing is packed full of pictures.  There are pages of messages and signatures of classmates.  There are snippets of scholarship letters.  What I like most about it is while there are lots of pictures from special events like Homecoming, the class trip, and Prom, there are other pages that really capture the day to day life of that year.

Here's a glimpse inside:

It's so nice to have all of these images bound together in one book.  It's a great snapshot of that moment in time.  


I like that this photo excludes the name of my school.  It wasn't intentional, but gives the photo a more universal appeal (or at least universal to anyone who graduated in 2001).  I cropped the original image and worked the levels to get a truer white background.
