I had a hard time with this week's challenge.  There are signs everywhere so it seems like it should be easy.  I considered [astrological signs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign).  I really liked the idea of a cheesy guy at a bar saying "Hey baby, what's your sign?"  Thinking about this made me laugh, but I couldn't figure out how to capture it.  I decided to do a nighttime shot of a neon sign, capturing the glow.

With a concept in mind, I needed to find the right sign.  I wanted to avoid bar signs if possible.  Jeremy suggested [The Vogue](http://visitsouth.com/articles/article/the-vogue-center-louisville-ky/), an old theater in town that has been converted to a shopping center.

Saturday evening, just before dark, we headed out.  I started out across the street from the building.  Like usual, I just started shooting and got many shots and angles from this position.  Some had streaks of headlights and taillights from cars that went by.  I liked these shots, but none of them were great.

Having taken enough wide shots, I decided to move in closer.  I like getting close to a subject.  Details are interesting to me.  This shot has an abstract feel to it.

Next door to The Vogue is an ice cream shop.  This photo tells a story.  You can see inside where someone is at the counter ordering.  It's a good shot, but not what I was after.

The next shot was my favorite.  I like the spot light.  It adds more interest.  I get the feel of an old time jazz club when I look at this.

The spot light reflected off of my UV filter and caused a green spot in the photo.  I used the clone tool to remove this.  I worked the levels and contrast.  The last thing I did was to adjust the color balance.  I added a blue cast which dampened the glow from the spot light and gave the white neon a cool feel.
