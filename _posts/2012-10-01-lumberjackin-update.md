I'm not real happy about it but we decided to pull the plug on this project.

There were several reasons the safety kitty pulled the plug on this project

1.  Alan's insurance wouldn't cover him for negligence.  My agent told me I was but it was a gray area and they might not pay out.
2.  After doing some reading on suburban walnut trees, it seems that their sap ring estimations can vary by an order of magnitude.  Possibly taking the yield to a point where the value is less than the rental price of the equipment.  (I could go buy retail cheaper and not spend 300 hours milling the wood and a year waiting for it to dry.)
3.  The price of the lift went up after we realized we would have to buy a specific insurance rider.
4.  There are plenty of trees in the world that don't carry this kind of risk.
5.  The tree that the guy really wanted cut down was the one that would have yielded the worst/least milled wood.

**For those of you that think I was/am crazy**

Here is the financial breakdown.  The dry wood would have given around a 70% ROI or we could have sold it wet for around a 55% ROI.  We could have sold it in a single day.

Beat that in the market.

**Future Plans**

I explained to the homeowner that everyone I pay to make good decisions in my life (my board of directors, hopefully I'll post on this eventually) has told me this is not a good idea.  He understood.  I also told him there was a universe in which we could still help him, namely if the trees were already on the ground or that he wanted to do the project with our "help".  But, for now this project is indefinitely shelved.  There are lots of trees in the world.
