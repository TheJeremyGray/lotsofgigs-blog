This week I wanted a photo that was literally simple.  Simple composition of a simple subject.  I have had my eye on a tree that sits right off the road near my in-laws for quite some time.  I finally got out there with my camera and the results were disappointing.  I'm blaming the overcast sky.  With no strong light source the scene just came out flat.  I did my best to edit the photos, but was unable to bring them to life.

I searched for another idea.  I tried to think of all things simple.  Simple joys.  Simple pleasures.  Simple living.  I finally hit on [simple machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine).  One of the six classical simple machines is the [screw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_(simple_machine)).

I got out the materials I needed plus my new macro lens.  Working with this lens definitely changes my view on aperture.  With my other lenses I've always loved opening the aperture all the way up.  If you do that with a macro lens, you end up with a tiny depth of field.  For this photo I set the aperture  to f/8 and still did not get the entire screw sharp.

For the edits I straightened, auto leveled, bumped contrast, then added a Hard Light layer at 70%.  I've used the Hard Light layer the last few weeks.  It has a way of adding that extra pop to the image.
