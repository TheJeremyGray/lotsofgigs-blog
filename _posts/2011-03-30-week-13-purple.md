I tried something new this week.  For the first time ever I dialed my camera to M.  

That's right, Manual Mode.  Crazy.

I learned a thing or two last Saturday about getting correct exposures in Manual mode and decided to give it a whirl.  I still have a ways to go, but I'm pretty happy with the results.

I went grocery shopping and thought I might find some purple inspiration.  Outside I spotted several racks of pansies.  I had my camera in tow so was able to have a mini photo shoot right there on the sidewalk.  This is one of the shots I got.  I like the color, but the composition is not very strong and the purple isn't prominent enough for me.

*Purple pansies.  Straight out of the camera.*



I made my way through the produce section, picked up a red cabbage and dropped it in my cart.  I got home, grabbed the cabbage, a knife, and my camera and went to work at the kitchen table.  Daylight was fading fast.  

I metered the light, adjusted my aperture and shutter speed, then started shooting.  I was having a hard time getting a fast enough shutter speed with available light so I flipped the overhead light on.  I thought I was getting some good shots.  It was a different story when I got them on the computer.  The mixed lighting gave the shots an off color and there were too many shadows.  I did my best to fix my favorites in the [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), but it was not working.

*Fading Daylight + Overhead Tungsten Light = blah.*



The next evening I tried again, hoping there would be enough light.  I set up on the table and quickly realized the light was still uneven.  I attempted using my homemade reflector to light the other side of my subject.  It softened the shadows, but did not remove them.

*Homemade reflector held up by canned goods.  Fancy.*

*Uneven Daylight*



I needed more light so I dug out some poster board and set up outside.  I stayed in the shade to avoid the harshness of direct sunlight.  This arrangement worked out great.  I had even light over my whole subject and the shadows were eliminated.  I metered the new light and adjusted my shutter speed accordingly.  I tried several different angles, but decided I liked the simplicity of the straight shot on this one.

I was much happier when I pulled these shots up on the computer.  The color was still a little off, but was easily corrected with levels.  I straightened the image, then cropped slightly.  I decided the photo would be better without the large piece of cabbage.  I added a new white layer with a full transparency (black) [layer mask](http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-layer-mask-add.html).  The layer mask kept the new layer invisible.  I "painted" the layer mask with white to reveal the new layer, covering up the cabbage.

This week taught me it is good to push yourself.  I have avoided Manual Mode because it seemed scary.  Armed with the correct information I was able to successfully use it.  This is a whole new challenge to tackle and I'm excited to see what happens.


13 weeks down. 39 to go.
