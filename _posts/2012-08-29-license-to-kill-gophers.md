My wife and I usually start thinking about Christmas presents in early November, maybe a little bit earlier.  We try to think of thoughtful gifts for everyone on our list, sometimes we do well and others we fall flat on our faces.  We have a lot of trouble with my brothers children.  He has four, two boys and two girls.

**The Problem**

Finding them something they don't already have that they would actually want.

**The Concept**

A homemade game, based on one of my [favorite movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddyshack).  I decided early on that this game should adhere to three general concepts.


1.  Teamwork - I didn't want them playing *against* each other
2.  Quiet - Its good for the parents and helps foster non-verbal communication
3.  Low Tech / Low Maintenance - They have a closet full of high tech stuff that require batteries and break easily. I wanted a low friction toy that could realistically be played with anything.

**The Solution**

My wife and I came up with a gopher themed capture the flag style game called "License to Kill Gophers"

**The Game**

The concept is pretty simple, someone hides "The Gopher".  Then, participants must covertly find the gophers hiding spot, capture him alive and transport him back to their base for trial. From the manual:


> You must covertly find the whereabouts of “The Gopher” and transport him back to your base for interrogation and trial.
>
> Remember, “The Gopher” has information vital to the National Security of the United States and all precautions should be taken to capture him alive.
>
> The safety of our nation and way of life rests firmly in your hands.


After we came up with the concept I was pretty sure it would be fun and it fit right in line with the original concept.  The kids would be on the same team fighting a common enemy, it is a covert mission, and there are no moving pieces to break.

**The Gopher**

Finding a suitable Caddyshack gopher turned out to be relatively difficult, the online price was higher than our budget for the game.  So I did what I always do when I am looking for something strange...I started talking to people about the concept and hitting them up for gophers that may be stashed away in the basements of family members.  This ended up paying off big time.  We were at dinner with our friends the [Weisenbargers](http://weisenbarger.com) and [Amy](http://weisenbarger.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/img_0185.jpg) remembered her Dad had a gopher in his garage.  She called him on the spot, here was the conversation:

~~~~~~~~
Amy: Dad, do you still have that gopher in the garage
Dad: I'm lookin at it right now
Amy: My friends are making a game for their nephews, can they have it.
Dad: Yep
Amy: Can I get it this week?
Dad: Yep
~~~~~~~~

And we had our gopher.

**The Uniform**

Since this is a military style game and we wanted the boys to be on the same team, we decided a uniform would be cool.  Initially, I just wanted a nameplate , dog tags and an American Flag but after we started thinking about the game we decided on a Velcro-able rank patch that would dictate their role in the game (more on this later).  The highest rank I could get was a colonel and when I told the nice woman on the phone at a local store that supplies police uniforms the name badges I wanted she almost wouldn’t sell them to me because “There aren’t any metro colonels named ‘Gray'”.  Needless to say we got it straitened out and it cost around $12.  Finally, we sewed the patches on some t-shirts.

And we had our uniform.

**The Box**

We needed something cool to put all this stuff in and I wanted some kind of military style enclosure.  During a trip to a local gun store I saw about 100 cases of Czechoslovakian Winchester .308 ammunition in awesome boxes.  I wasn't interested in the ammo but when I asked the guy how much the box would be he ended up and just gave it to us.  Since this gift was one-of-a-kind I wanted to personalize it, so I did a terrible spray paint job of their names and a G.I. Joe style logo.  Seriously, I over-sprayed this so much that I ended up over-spraying the entire box so it would look right.

And we had our box.

**The Instructions**

This was all the "stuff" we needed, now we just had to finalize how to play the game and get the package all pretty.  This turned out to take much longer than I expected.  I wanted the game to allow for creative thought, but needed some basic parameters for how the game should be played.  Here are the rules we came up with and the first page in the manual:

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/rules.png">![The Rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rules.png)</a>


This part was relatively easy, but I felt like I needed a looser structure to encourage them to think and be creative.  So I came up with the different ranks or roles that I felt were appropriate to the theme of the game.  The ranks, listed below, are colonel, captain, and sergeant.  These are all attached with Velcro to the uniform shirts so they can switch ranks if they want.

Explaining ranks and the chain of command to kids who can't read turned out to be fairly difficult.  Here is what I came up with:

> The chain of command is a series of ranks or positions in which each has a direct authority over the one below.  It is important to understand that higher ranks
> are not necessarily better; they just have different jobs and responsibilities.  There is always an atmosphere of respect between the ranks and everyone 
> understands that instructions flow down, but responsibility flows up.  So, while a Colonel can tell everyone what to do, he is ultimately responsible for the 
> actions of all the soldiers under his command. 
>
>When others in your chain of command succeed, you succeed.

And we had the instructions.

**Finally**

If you would like to read the entire instruction manual you can download it [here](http://bit.ly/PSsDIH).  We cut out the pages, punched holes in the top, and bound with some black [550 cord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_cord).  I think the whole thing turned out nice and I'm sure the kids will play it for a long time.

If you decide to build one of these or are inspired to build one, DO IT and send me some pictures.  It you want to market it and make some money, I've got lots more ideas...send me an email.
